I got an A for this project [FOCUSart](https://www.focusart.info/)

<h1>FOCUSart</h1>

Focusart is a website made to help and promote artists. It's also a website for people that wants to discover new art and to come closer to the artist.
What I found out in my research is that existing websites is putting a lot of attention just on the drawings or paintings, not that much attention to the actual artist. That's were I think my concept could be a success.
